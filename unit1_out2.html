        <p>2.1 Tools to create website were Visual Studio, Git, GitHub Trello: -</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Visual Studio Code enabled HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be written.</li>
                <li>GitHub I learned to create a repository and update it as code development progressed.</li>
                <li>CodePen is something that I did not look into.</li>
                <li>Trello was learned as a project planning tool.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>2.2 Comments on appropriateness of tools: -</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Visual Studio gave me a nice GUI tool to develop code and do debugging</li>
                <li>Trello project planning tool was new and easy to learn for small project plannings tasks</li>
                <li>Trello was too simplistic but adequate for my needs.</li>
                <li>Trello did not allow me to link tasks for dependencies.</li>
                <li>Tellow did not allow me to set milestones and print out latest pictorial view of project status</li>
                <li>Trello did not allow me to perform queries on project status, man hours and costing.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>2.3 My review section has been implemented via drop down menu and sub-menu</p>

        <p>2.4 For future improvement, I will consider the following: -</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use of button hover text</li>
            <li>Restructure website with nice look and feel</li>
            <li>Use neutral colours and nice fonted and backgroud text</li>
        </ol>

        <p>2.5 Learning objectives can be viewed as they are incorporated in the website and find that work is of adequate standard. -</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I used scroll bars, drop down menus, flexBox</li>
            <li>I find that I learned the objectives quite adequately.</li>
        </ol>
